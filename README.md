# YTMETA - An API to fetch YouTube video metadata

There are a lot of YouTube video downloaders out there. By making use of tools like `youtube-dl`, they get the job done. But `ytmeta` is different. It is an API that returns necessary data to create your own downloader. Now you can create beautiful frontends with your favourite tools like, Reactjs, Vuejs, Sveltejs and whatnot.

It returns data including `title`, `views`, `links to thumbnail` and `various formats along with links to them`. Just an API call and get all the data you need in quick time.

### Usage

`curl https://ytmeta.tk/api/v1/{video_id}`

> example: https://ytmeta.tk/api/v1/BalvzyKg_4k

This should return all the necessary data required to create an app.
